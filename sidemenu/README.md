# Sidemenu App

This is an app with a left sidemenu. Each page that you access from the menu demonstrates a different aspect of the API.

## Notes

When you put embedded YouTube videos in the page, you can drag your finger across the videos on Android, but not on iOS. The way I've done it now, you have to drag on the margins of the page in iOS in order to scroll the page downwards.
